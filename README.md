# PPP - Personal Passion Project

This is a personal project for my studies (Digital Design and Development - Devine @ Howest-Kask).

- The customer

The customer for this project is mainly myself. It would be an app that I could use a lot and would be handy for me.
But anyone could be 'a customer' to my project, because I want to make it an app that is useful and customizable for everybody.

- Core Project Statement

The core project statement of this project is an app that helps you plan/manage all sorts of things in daily life. I want to make an app that helps you decide what jacket you should were according to the weather, but also an app that just keeps you up to date with wathever you want, football results, releases of your favourite artists, the traffic on your way to work, how much you sleep...

It should be an app that helps you not to miss or forget some essential things in your daily life.

- Deliverables

What I want to deliver is an app that is available on ios and android.
